            Late. Shri. Suresh Angadi, Former MoS, Railways, Govt. of India,
            Former four term Member of Parliament, Belagavi and Founder
            Chairman, Suresh Angadi Education Foundation (SAEF) was a devout
            follower of Swami Vivekananda and his principles. His philosophy has
            been that education should not merely be gathering knowledge, rather
            it should be about developing the mind to broaden the horizon of
            thinking. In 2008 he built “Suresh Angadi Education Foundation” on
            the pillars of Discipline, Dedication and Determination with an
            intention to provide education to the person at the last mile so
            that even the needy have access to quality education. His ai, was to
            provide quality education at affordable cost especially for rural
            students. He believed that the purpose of education is not just
            restricted to imparting academic knowledge but to inculcate among
            the students humanitarian values like wisdom, compassion, courage,
            humility and integrity. In this regard, he always appealed to the
            students of SAEF to become fearless seekers of true knowledge in
            their quest of success. He always encouraged and motivated teachers
            so that they keep the flame of inquisitiveness alive among the
            students. His dream was to make Belagavi a top educational hub in
            this country by providing excellent educational facilities to
            students who comes from various backgrounds. Lastly, he believed and
            lived upto the saying “WORK IS WORSHIP”. A proverb that repeatedly
            reminds us that it is essential to take an intent in what we do.
            Unless we follow our passion and do what we generally love to do, we
            will never be able to achieve success.
